Objectives
- Learn to move things around with "mv"
- "mv" can be used to rename files and directories
- Learn to distinguish files and directories from each other

Task
- Move all three statues onto matching pressure sensors (directories)
- Each sensor has space only for one statue

Question
- No answer this time. Move things around and run "./unlock.sh".

Hints and tips
- Check the documentation: `man mv`
- Basic syntax of "mv" is "mv target destination" where both target and destination can be a directory or a file
- Note that not every file has to have an extension like ".txt". Can you tell which items are files and which are directories?
