Basement. You've entered into a moist and distressing corridor with narrowing walls. You walk 
towards and suddenly! A dead end! A wall without hinges or handles. You bring the torch closer to 
the wall and suddenly you notice five holes on the wall with particularly even spacing. One has a 
short peg in it. Maybe you should fill the other holes as well?
