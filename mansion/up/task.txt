Objectives
- Learn to list files and directories using "ls" command
- Learn what ".", ".." are

Task
- Learn to list content of a directory
- Run "ls .". What do you see? What about "ls" only? 
- Run "ls ..". What do you see then?
- What happens if you give a directory name as a parameter "ls <some-directory>"
- Find a flag which shows more information about file than the names. HINT: hidden files starts with a dot ".hidden-file"
- Find a flag which shows file sizes in human readable form

Question
- What is the human readable size of a one hidden file within one of the directories you have access to? HINT: 3 characters

Hints and tips
- Start by reading "man ls" 
- Open shorter instructions of a command using "-h" flag e.g. "ls -h". NOTE: doesn't work on every command.
- With "ls" you can list short information as well as sizes and sort files and directories
