Objectives
- Learn to navigate effortlessly by mastering "cd"
- Find where you are with "pwd"
- Learn the differences with ~, - and / when "cding" around

Task
- Find where you are:
  - Run: "pwd" to print directory path to your current location
- Run "cd .". What happens?
- Run "cd ..". Where are you now? Can you find back where you were?
- Add directory after the command to enter it: "cd up"
- Directories can be chained up and down to the dir tree:
  - Move up to three made up directories "cd dir1/dir2/dir3" 
  - Move down to three directories "cd ../../.."
  - PROTIP: Always check whether directories exists by doubple tapping "tab"
- To go forward you must find the "key.txt" file within the "maze" directory

Advanced task
- Run "cd". Note no extra params. Where you are now?
  - Most unix compatible distros marks home directory as "~"
  - "cd" is same as "cd ~" and "cd /home/<username>"
- Adding dash "-" after the command brings you bach to the last directory. Try it "cd -"

Question
- What is the whole path from this directory to the "key.txt"? 
- Give a single command which could move you to the directory file starting with "./maze"
- Answer format: "cd ./maze/..."

Hints and tips
- "cd" aka "chdir" aka "change directory" is a command for changing the current working directory.
- Similarly to "ls" the cd also works with "." and ".." notations plus various other e.g. "~" and "-"
- "cd /" gets to the root directory. You can't go any deeper than that
  - NOTE: home directory is one level up from root "/home/<username">
